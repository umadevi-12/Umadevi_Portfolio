# React + Vite Template

This project is a minimal setup for React with Vite, providing a fast development environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint integration.

It includes options for two official Vite plugins:

@vitejs/plugin-react – Uses Babel for React Fast Refresh.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc – Uses SWC compiler for faster React Fast Refresh.

# ESLint Configuration

For production applications, it’s recommended to use TypeScript with type-aware ESLint rules enabled.

For TypeScript integration, refer to the official Vite TS template for typescript-eslint configuration.
